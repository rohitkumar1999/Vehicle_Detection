## Getting Started

The Vehicles_detection.py is an organisation script and is supposed to be executed by the parking authorities/companies using their cctv footages as input. The algorithm counts the number of cars and calculates slots left in a given parking lot. This number is then passed on to the user through a mobile application.

### Prerequisites

The mobile application is a stand-alone apk file. No external dependencies required.
Any required dependencies for the algorithm can be installed using.

```
python install.py
```

## Running the tests
Clone the repository.
Add cctv footages to be analysed into the parent directory where vehicle_detection.py exist ([some_examples](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kayO8KoOVQkK1mucxAItKCpUVrvCgWmw)), open a terminal and execute command,
```
python Vehicles_detection.py
```

## Deployment

The end to end stack of the software is deployed in heroku. (only the application has access to the url)
